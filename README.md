## Introduction

Webform Submit Button allows a webform creator to position the submit button
inside a webform.  By default webform submit buttons are placed at the bottom
of a webform and cannot be moved.  

## Installation

Webform Submit Button is installed in the usual way. See [Installing modules (Drupal 7)]
(https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7).

## Usage

This module creates a new webform component called submit_button. The component
can be placed in the webform like any other webform.  It has no meaningful 
settings on it's own.  It becomes a placeholder for the real submit button that
is generated by webforms.  On hook_form_alter the placeholder is removed and 
replaced by the webform submit button.
